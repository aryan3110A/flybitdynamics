    title: "General Questions",
    faqs: [
      {
        question: "How many drones do you use in a typical show?",
        answer: "The number of drones varies based on your event size and requirements. We can create stunning shows with as few as 50 drones for intimate events, or spectacular displays with 500+ drones for large-scale celebrations. During consultation, we'll recommend the optimal fleet size for your specific needs and budget."
      },
      {
        question: "What's the cost of a drone light show?",
        answer: "Pricing depends on several factors including the number of drones, show duration, complexity of choreography, location, and special requirements. Our packages start from ₹1,50,000 for social events and scale up for larger productions. We provide detailed quotes after understanding your specific needs during our free consultation."
      },
      {
        question: "How much advance notice do you need for booking?",
        answer: "We recommend booking at least 4-6 weeks in advance to ensure availability and allow adequate time for custom choreography design. For peak seasons (wedding season, festivals) or large-scale events, we suggest booking 2-3 months ahead. Rush bookings may be possible with additional coordination fees."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you provide shows across India?",
        answer: "Yes! We provide drone light shows across major cities in India including Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad, Pune, and many others. Our team travels to your location with all necessary equipment and handles local coordination, permits, and logistics."
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    title: "Technical & Safety",
    faqs: [
      {
        question: "How much space is needed for a drone show?",
        answer: "The minimum space requirement depends on the number of drones and show complexity. Generally, we need an open area of at least 100m x 100m for smaller shows (50-100 drones) and up to 300m x 300m for large displays (300+ drones). We also require a 30m safety buffer around the performance area and consideration for flight height restrictions."
      },
      {
        question: "Can drone shows be performed indoors?",
        answer: "Indoor shows are possible but require special considerations. The venue must have sufficient ceiling height (minimum 10-15 meters), adequate space, and proper ventilation. Indoor shows typically use fewer drones (10-50) and specialized indoor-rated equipment. We conduct thorough site surveys to determine feasibility."
      },
      {
        question: "What about safety and permissions?",
        answer: "Safety is our top priority. All our drones are equipped with multiple safety systems including collision avoidance, automatic return-to-home, and emergency landing protocols. We handle all necessary permissions including DGCA approvals, local police clearances, and NOCs. Our pilots are certified and we maintain comprehensive insurance coverage."
      },
      {
        question: "What happens if weather conditions are poor?",
        answer: "We continuously monitor weather conditions leading up to your event. Light rain and mild winds (under 15 mph) typically don't affect the show. However, heavy rain, strong winds, or thunderstorms require postponement for safety. We include one free reschedule date and work with you to find alternative solutions."
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    title: "Show Customization",
    faqs: [
      {
        question: "How customizable are the shows?",
        answer: "Every show is 100% customizable! We create bespoke choreography based on your vision, theme, and requirements. This includes custom logos, text, shapes, animations, color schemes, and musical synchronization. Our design team works closely with you through multiple iterations until the show perfectly matches your vision."
      },
      {
        question: "Can you incorporate our company logo or personal messages?",
        answer: "Absolutely! We specialize in creating custom animations featuring company logos, personal messages, names, dates, and even complex graphics. Our 3D animation suite allows us to recreate virtually any design in the sky. We provide preview animations before the show for your approval."
      },
      {
        question: "How long does a typical show last?",
        answer: "Show duration typically ranges from 5-15 minutes depending on your requirements and battery capacity. Most clients prefer 8-10 minute shows which provide excellent entertainment value while maintaining drone performance. For longer events, we can create multiple shorter segments or coordinate with other entertainment elements."
      },
      {
        question: "Can you synchronize the show with music?",
        answer: "Yes! Musical synchronization is one of our specialties. We can choreograph the entire show to match your chosen soundtrack, creating perfectly timed movements, color changes, and formations that enhance the emotional impact. We work with your preferred music or can recommend suitable tracks for your event theme."
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    title: "Booking & Logistics",
    faqs: [
      {
        question: "What's included in your service package?",
        answer: "Our comprehensive package includes: initial consultation and site survey, custom choreography design, all drone equipment and lighting, certified pilots and ground crew, insurance coverage, permit handling, setup and breakdown, backup equipment, and post-show support. We handle everything so you can focus on enjoying your event."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you provide backup plans?",
        answer: "Yes, we always have contingency plans. This includes backup drones, alternative show formats for different weather conditions, backup power systems, and redundant communication equipment. We also have partnerships with local suppliers in major cities for emergency equipment replacement if needed."
      },
      {
        question: "What information do you need to provide a quote?",
        answer: "To provide an accurate quote, we need: event date and time, location details, expected audience size, event type and theme, preferred show duration, number of drones (if you have a preference), budget range, and any specific requirements or custom elements. The more details you provide, the more precise our quote will be."
      },
      {
        question: "What are your payment terms?",
        answer: "We typically require a 50% advance payment upon contract signing to secure your date and begin show preparation, with the remaining 50% due before the event. For large events, we can arrange milestone-based payments. We accept bank transfers, cheques, and digital payments. All payments include applicable taxes."
